# Moments of an increment of the Itô integral

The fourth moment of `∫_a^b H dW` for an integrand bounded by `C` is at most
`(6 + c)·C⁴·(b − a)²`, with `c` the fourth moment of the standard Gaussian. The bound is the
per-tile variance budget of `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.SimplePredictable.varClock` applied to
simple approximants of `1_{(a, b]}·H` that themselves vanish off `(a, b]`, obtained by
multiplying an approximant by `stepIoc` on their common refinement. The second and third
absolute moments are bounded from the same construction.

The development is split into:

* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.ItoIncrementMomentRestrict` — restriction of an adapted simple
  integrand to `(a, b]` and the variance budget of the resulting per-tile bound.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.ItoIncrementMomentBounds` — the fourth-, second- and third-moment
  bounds for an increment of the `L²` Itô integral.
