# The càdlàg conditional-expectation martingale of a joint filtration

Every square-integrable random variable `ξ` measurable at time `T` for the joint
right-continuous filtration of a Brownian motion `W` and a Poisson random measure `N` is the
terminal value of a càdlàg square-integrable martingale on that filtration whose value at time
`0` is `𝔼 ξ` (`condExp_to_PRP_martingale_form`). The content of that theorem is Doob's `L²`
càdlàg regularisation of the conditional-expectation martingale `t ↦ 𝔼[ξ ∣ ℱ₊ t]`
(Karatzas–Shreve I.3.13), together with Blumenthal's 0-1 law for the joint filtration, which is
what identifies the value at time `0` with `𝔼 ξ`. The martingale is
`LevyDriver.cadlagCondExp`, built in `Driver/CadlagMartingale.lean`.

The theorem contains no predictable representation. Neither `W` nor the compensated measure
`Ñ` occurs in its conclusion, and nothing in it exhibits the martingale as a stochastic
integral. The representation this library does state is the terminal-time one,
`LevyDriver.exists_predictable_jointIntegral` in `Driver/PredictableRepresentation.lean`, which
writes a square-integrable `ℱ_T`-measurable `Z` as `∑ i, ∫₀ᵀ G i dWⁱ + ∫₀ᵀ ∫ K dÑ` for
predictable integrands `G` and `K`. The process-level identity
`M_t = M_0 + ∫₀ᵗ G dW + ∫₀ᵗ ∫ K dÑ` for all `t` is stated nowhere in this library.

Jacod 1975 and Jacod–Shiryaev III.4.34 are the literature for that predictable representation,
not for the theorem below. The formulation `jacodYor_PRP_martingale_axiom`, asking for
integrands adapted to the natural filtration of a single driver — the class the `L²` integrals
of this library were then built on — while the martingale is one of the joint filtration, is
refutable: the martingale `W_t · Ñ_t` is not representable in that class
(`tools/cited_axioms.md`, `Retired #13a`). The integrals now take a common filtration `ℱ` with
`IsBrownianFiltration` and `IsPoissonFiltration` hypotheses; restating the property over the
joint filtration of an independent pair `(W, N)` is `Plan.md`'s work package B5, whose
single-driver halves are `Brownian/PRPMultidimAssembly.lean` and
`Poisson/PredictableRepresentation.lean`.
