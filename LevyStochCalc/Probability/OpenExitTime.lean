# Exit times from an open ball, for right-continuous paths

`openExitTime X R ω` is the first nonnegative time at which the path `X ω` has norm strictly
greater than `R`, and `⊤` when the path never leaves the closed ball. Strict exceedance is the
right notion for a path that is only right-continuous: the set of states of norm greater than `R`
is open, so a single exceedance propagates to a right neighbourhood and is therefore witnessed at
a rational time. That makes `{openExitTime < t}` measurable for the time-`t` σ-algebra, and hence
`openExitTime` a stopping time for the right-continuation of the filtration.

Below the exit time the path stays in the closed ball, and a path bounded by `R` on `[0, T]` has
not exited by `T`; neither fact needs any path regularity.

## Main statements

* `openExitTime_lt_coe_iff` — for a right-continuous path, the exit time is below `t` exactly
  when some rational time of `[0, t)` sees the norm exceed `R`.
* `isStoppingTime_openExitTime` — the exit time is a stopping time for `ℱ.rightCont`.
* `norm_le_of_lt_openExitTime` — strictly below the exit time the path has norm at most `R`.
* `le_openExitTime_of_forall_norm_le` — a path bounded by `R` on `[0, T]` has not exited by `T`.
