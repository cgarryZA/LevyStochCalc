# Completeness of the Lévy–Prokhorov metric

On a proper metric space `Ω` (for instance `ℝ` or `ℝⁿ`) with its Borel σ-algebra, the
Lévy–Prokhorov metric on probability measures is complete.

A totally bounded set of probability measures is tight: take a finite `ε/2`-net, a compact set `K`
carrying all but `ε/2` of the mass of each net point, and the closed `ε/2`-thickening of `K`, which
is compact because `Ω` is proper; the Lévy–Prokhorov thickening inequality transfers the mass bound
from each net point to every measure near it. By Prokhorov's theorem a tight set has compact
closure, so the range of a Cauchy sequence is relatively compact and the sequence converges.

## Main statements

* `LevyStochCalc.Probability.isTightMeasureSet_of_totallyBounded` — a totally bounded set of
  probability measures is tight.
* `LevyStochCalc.Probability.isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet_levyProkhorov` — Prokhorov's
  theorem in the Lévy–Prokhorov metric: a tight set has compact closure.
* `LevyStochCalc.Probability.instCompleteSpaceLevyProkhorovProbabilityMeasure` — the
  Lévy–Prokhorov metric space of probability measures is complete.
