# Measurability for an augmented σ-algebra

A set measurable for `aug m m₀ μ` differs from an `m`-measurable set by a `μ`-null set, so its
indicator is almost everywhere an `m`-measurable indicator. Passing through simple functions and
their limits, a function strongly measurable for `aug m m₀ μ` is almost everywhere equal to an
`m`-strongly-measurable function.
