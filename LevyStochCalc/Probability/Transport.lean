# Independence along a measure-preserving map

If `h : α → β` is measure preserving from `μa` to `μb`, then independence transports
backwards along `h`: independent sub-σ-algebras of `β` have independent comaps in `α`,
and independent random variables on `β` stay independent after pre-composition with `h`.

## Main statements

* `indep_comap_of_measurePreserving` — for two sub-σ-algebras;
* `indepFun_comp_of_measurePreserving` — for a pair of random variables;
* `iIndepFun_comp_of_measurePreserving` — for a family of random variables.
