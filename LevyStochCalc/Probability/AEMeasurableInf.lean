# A.e. measurability for the infimum of a decreasing sequence of σ-algebras

A real function a.e.-measurable for every member of an antitone sequence of sub-σ-algebras is
a.e.-measurable for their infimum. The witness is the `limsup` of the approximants: dropping the
first `N` terms does not change a `limsup`, and after that every approximant is `m N`-measurable,
while on the a.e. set where all the approximants agree with `f` the `limsup` is `f` itself.

This is the step that identifies `⨅ n, lpMeas (m n)` with `lpMeas (⨅ n, m n)`, which is what turns
the convergence of orthogonal projections (`LevyStochCalc/Probability/ProjectionLimit.lean`) into
convergence of conditional expectations along a decreasing filtration.
