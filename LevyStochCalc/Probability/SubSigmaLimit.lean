# Almost-everywhere limits for a sub-σ-algebra

The set on which a sequence of functions converges is measurable for the σ-algebra the functions
are measurable for, so the limit taken there and `0` elsewhere is an everywhere-limit of
functions measurable for that σ-algebra. An almost-everywhere pointwise limit of functions
strongly measurable for a sub-σ-algebra is therefore almost everywhere equal to a function
strongly measurable for it.
