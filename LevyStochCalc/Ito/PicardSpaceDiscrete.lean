# Discrete metric on the space of bounded processes

The constant-zero path map inhabits the space `SBoundedProcess` of L²-sup-bounded adapted
processes, and the discrete distance `dist X Y = if X = Y then 0 else 1` makes that space a
complete metric space: a sequence that is Cauchy at scale `< 1` is eventually constant, hence
convergent. The discrete metric carries no analytic content and is not the `S²` or Bielecki
norm; it only supplies the `MetricSpace`/`CompleteSpace` typeclass arguments of the generic
Banach fixed-point shim, the analytic contraction being carried by the Bielecki β-weighted
pseudo-edist of `Ito/PicardSpaceBieleckiEDist.lean`.

/-- **Constant-zero `SBoundedProcess`.** The map `X t ω = 0` (the zero
vector in `Fin n → ℝ`) is the canonical witness of `Nonempty
(SBoundedProcess P T)`:

* **Measurability** — `Function.uncurry (fun _ _ => 0) = fun _ => 0` is the
  zero constant, hence trivially measurable (`Measurable.const 0`).
* **Càdlàg paths** — every constant function is continuous, so the
  right-limit `Filter.Tendsto` is `tendsto_const_nhds`; for the left
  limit, the witness `L = 0` makes the left-limit `Filter.Tendsto` also
  `tendsto_const_nhds`.
* **`sup_L2`** — `bieleckiNorm β T 0 = 0 < ⊤` because the integrand
  `(∑ i, ‖0‖²) = 0` makes the inner `∫⁻` and the outer rpow both zero;
  multiplying by `ENNReal.ofReal (exp (-β·t))` and taking the supremum
  over `t ∈ [0, T]` still gives zero, which is `< ⊤`. -/

/-! ### MetricSpace: discrete metric for typeclass satisfaction.

**Typeclass-placeholder notice:** the metric
installed in this section is the *discrete metric* on `SBoundedProcess`:
`dist X Y = 0 if X = Y, else 1`. This satisfies all `MetricSpace` axioms
mechanically but carries **NO substantive analytical content**: it makes
every fixed-point question on `SBoundedProcess`-with-this-metric trivially
discrete (Cauchy ↔ eventually constant; contractions ↔ identity on the
fixed-point fibre; the unique fixed point is the starting iterate). The
goal of this instance is to discharge the typeclass obligation of the
generic Banach shim `picardFixedPoint`, NOT to deliver mathematics.

The literature Banach work (Bielecki β-weighted L²-sup norm with genuine
contraction at the analytical rate `3 n L² (T+2) / (2β)` for
`β > 3 n L² (T+2) / 2`) is carried by the pseudo-edist `bieleckiNorm` on
path maps: the contraction estimate is `bieleckiNorm_picardSelfMap_diff_le`
(`Ito/PicardContraction.lean`) and the well-posedness theorem is
`exists_jumpDiffusion_unique_of_solvesOn` (`Ito/PicardWellPosed.lean`).
Downstream consumers should treat the discrete-metric `picardFixedPoint`
invocation on `SBoundedProcess` as a typeclass shim only.

This is a genuine metric (separation holds by definition, triangle inequality
holds via case analysis), and is **complete** because every Cauchy sequence
in the discrete metric is eventually constant (Cauchy at scale `< 1` forces
all sufficiently far-out terms to be equal).

The discrete metric is **not** the literature `S²` / Bielecki norm — that
is a pseudometric on `SBoundedProcess` (zero distance iff a.s.-equal,
which is weaker than structure equality). The actual Picard contraction
estimate is developed against the pseudo-edist `bieleckiNorm (X - Y)`
in the `bielecki_*` lemma family and against the genuine metric on
`AEQuot β T`, and is logically independent of which `MetricSpace`
instance lives on the `SBoundedProcess` structure type.

section DiscreteMetric
-- The discrete metric construction below uses `if X = Y then 0 else 1`,
-- which needs `Decidable (X = Y)`. Since `SBoundedProcess` is not decidably
-- equal in general, we `open Classical` for this section so the elaborator
-- pulls in the classical decidability instance. Linter is locally disabled
-- via a `set_option` because the `open Classical` is the simplest tactic
-- to thread classical decidability through every declaration in the section.

the Cauchy property at scale `ε = 1/2`: any two terms `u m`, `u n` with
`m, n ≥ N` have `dist (u m) (u n) < 1`, hence by the discrete distance
must satisfy `u m = u n`. -/

to that constant value.

We use `complete_of_cauchySeq_tendsto`: a uniform space with countable
basis of the uniformity (automatic for metric spaces) is complete iff
every Cauchy *sequence* converges. The discrete metric makes every Cauchy
sequence eventually constant (by `cauchySeq_eventually_constant`), and an
eventually-constant sequence converges to its eventual value. -/
