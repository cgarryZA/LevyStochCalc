# Transferring an identity along an exhausting family of events

An almost-everywhere identity that holds on each member of a family of events covering almost
every sample point holds outright. The family used to localise an Itô formula is the set of
sample points whose path stays inside a ball over a bounded window; a path that is bounded on
that window lies in one of them, so the family covers, and on the `m`-th member a function and
its cutoff at radius `m` agree along the path together with their first two derivatives.

## Main statements

* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.ae_eq_of_ae_eq_on_exhausting` — the transfer.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.boundedPathSet` — the sample points whose path stays in a ball.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.ae_exists_mem_boundedPathSet` — a path bounded on the window lies
  in one member of the family.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.cutoffFun_eq_on_boundedPathSet` — on the `m`-th member the cutoff
  at a strictly larger radius agrees with the function along the path, as do its first two
  derivatives.
