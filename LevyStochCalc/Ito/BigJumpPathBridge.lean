# The big-jump path as a member of the big-jump sequence

The path of a jump diffusion with the jumps carried by one measurable mark set removed is the
corresponding member of the sequence of big-jump processes built from the jump-integrand data of
its SDE, and the two constructions coincide coordinatewise at the level of the subtracted
compensated integrals as well.

## Main statements

* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.BigJump.cutJumpIntegral_eq_smallJumpIntegral` — the truncated compensated
  integral at the `m`-th mark set is the `m`-th small-jump integral of the jump-integrand data.
* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.BigJump.bigJumpPath_eq_bigJumpProcess` — the big-jump path at the `m`-th
  mark set is the `m`-th big-jump process of the jump-integrand data.
* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.BigJump.bigJumpPath_smallMarks_eq_bigJumpProcess` — the same identity along
  the complements of a spanning family of the intensity.
