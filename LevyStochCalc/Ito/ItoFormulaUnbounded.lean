# Itô's formula without a pointwise bound on the coefficients

Clamping the coefficients of a vector Itô process at level `j` leaves bounded coefficients driving
a process that converges to the original one in `L²`, uniformly on a bounded window. The
development is spread over three files, which this one collects:

* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.ItoFormulaUnboundedClamp` — the clamped coefficients and the `L²`
  approximation of the process they drive;
* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.ItoFormulaUnboundedIntegrands` — convergence of the drift, quadratic
  variation and diffusion integrands built from the clamped coefficients;
* `LevyStochCalc.Ito.ItoFormulaUnboundedLimit` — the limit of the stochastic integrals and Itô's
  formula for unbounded coefficients.

## Main statements

* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.clampCoeff`, `clampDrift` — the clamped coefficients.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.tendsto_energy_window_clamp` — the mesh of the approximation.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.itoFormula_of_unbounded_coeff` — Itô's formula with unbounded
  coefficients, for a function with bounded first and second derivatives.
* `LevyStochCalc.Brownian.Ito.itoFormula_of_unbounded` — Itô's formula for a `C²` function of a
  vector Itô process, with no bound on either the coefficients or the derivatives.
